### What is Django? 
Django is a Python-based free and open-source web framework that follows the model-template-view (MVC) architectural pattern.

The core Django framework can be seen as an MVC architecture.
* It consists of an object-relational mapper (ORM) that mediates between data models (defined as Python classes)
* Model:  a relational database.
* View:   a system for processing HTTP requests with a web templating system.
* Controller: a regular-expression-based URL dispatcher.
